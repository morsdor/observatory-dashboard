# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Observatory is a high-performance real-time data dashboard designed to visualize and interact with large streaming datasets of over 100,000 data points. Built with Next.js and shadcn/ui components, the system will provide real-time monitoring capabilities through WebSocket connections, featuring interactive charts, virtualized data grids, and advanced multi-faceted filtering systems. This dashboard addresses the core challenges faced by large-scale organizations in monitoring vast infrastructures and data-driven operations in real-time.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Real-Time Data Streaming

**User Story:** As a data analyst, I want to receive real-time data updates through WebSocket connections, so that I can monitor live system metrics and respond to changes immediately.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the dashboard loads THEN the system SHALL establish a WebSocket connection to receive streaming data
2. WHEN new data arrives via WebSocket THEN the system SHALL update the display within 100ms
3. WHEN the WebSocket connection is lost THEN the system SHALL attempt automatic reconnection every 5 seconds
4. WHEN data streaming is active THEN the system SHALL handle at least 1000 data points per second without performance degradation
5. IF the data buffer exceeds 100,000 points THEN the system SHALL implement a sliding window to maintain performance

### Requirement 2: High-Performance Data Visualization

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to view large datasets in interactive charts without performance issues, so that I can analyze trends and patterns in real-time data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN displaying time-series data THEN the system SHALL render charts with up to 100,000 data points without browser lag
2. WHEN users interact with charts THEN the system SHALL provide zoom, pan, and tooltip functionality with sub-100ms response times
3. WHEN chart data updates THEN the system SHALL only re-render changed portions to maintain 60fps performance
4. IF users hover over data points THEN the system SHALL display contextual information within 50ms
5. WHEN multiple charts are displayed THEN the system SHALL maintain interactive performance across all visualizations

### Requirement 3: Virtualized Data Grid Display

**User Story:** As a data engineer, I want to browse through large datasets in a table format without performance issues, so that I can examine individual data points and identify specific records.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN displaying tabular data THEN the system SHALL use virtualization to render only visible rows
2. WHEN users scroll through data THEN the system SHALL maintain smooth scrolling performance regardless of dataset size
3. WHEN the dataset contains 100,000+ rows THEN the system SHALL render only 20-50 visible rows in the DOM at any time
4. IF users scroll rapidly THEN the system SHALL update visible content without visual artifacts or delays
5. WHEN new data arrives THEN the system SHALL append to the virtualized list without re-rendering existing items

### Requirement 4: Advanced Multi-Faceted Filtering

**User Story:** As a business analyst, I want to create complex filter queries across multiple data dimensions, so that I can isolate specific subsets of data for detailed analysis.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users create filters THEN the system SHALL support text, numeric, date range, and categorical filtering
2. WHEN users combine filters THEN the system SHALL support AND/OR logical operators with grouping
3. WHEN filter criteria change THEN the system SHALL update results within 200ms for datasets up to 100,000 points
4. IF users build complex filter expressions THEN the system SHALL provide a visual query builder interface
5. WHEN filters are applied THEN the system SHALL update both charts and data grid simultaneously
6. WHEN users save filter configurations THEN the system SHALL persist and restore filter states

### Requirement 5: Performance Optimization and Monitoring

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the dashboard to maintain consistent performance under heavy load, so that multiple users can access real-time data without system degradation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the dashboard is under load THEN the system SHALL maintain sub-200ms response times for user interactions
2. WHEN memory usage exceeds thresholds THEN the system SHALL implement garbage collection strategies
3. WHEN rendering large datasets THEN the system SHALL use efficient algorithms to prevent UI blocking
4. IF performance degrades THEN the system SHALL provide performance metrics and diagnostics
5. WHEN multiple users access the dashboard THEN the system SHALL scale to support at least 100 concurrent connections

### Requirement 6: Interactive User Experience

**User Story:** As an operations manager, I want intuitive controls and responsive interactions built with modern UI components, so that I can efficiently navigate and analyze data without technical expertise.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users interact with any UI element THEN the system SHALL provide immediate visual feedback using shadcn/ui components
2. WHEN users perform actions THEN the system SHALL maintain state consistency across all components
3. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL display clear, actionable error messages using consistent design patterns
4. IF users perform invalid operations THEN the system SHALL prevent data corruption and guide users to valid actions
5. WHEN the dashboard loads THEN the system SHALL display a functional Next.js-powered interface within 3 seconds
6. WHEN users navigate between views THEN the system SHALL leverage Next.js routing for seamless transitions

### Requirement 7: Data Integrity and Reliability

**User Story:** As a data scientist, I want assurance that displayed data is accurate and complete, so that I can make reliable decisions based on the dashboard information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN data is received THEN the system SHALL validate data integrity before display
2. WHEN data transmission errors occur THEN the system SHALL detect and handle corrupted data gracefully
3. WHEN displaying filtered data THEN the system SHALL maintain accuracy of calculations and aggregations
4. IF data inconsistencies are detected THEN the system SHALL alert users and provide error details
5. WHEN data updates occur THEN the system SHALL ensure atomic updates to prevent partial state display
